## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Offline sandbox + `Amarula.Testing`** — test your bot's receive→reply logic
  with no WhatsApp connection. `Amarula.new(%{profile: x, offline: true})` runs a
  connection with no socket whose `send_*` calls short-circuit to `{:ok, msg_id}`
  (no encrypt, no frame, no real-world effect). `Amarula.Testing.start_offline/1`
  starts one; `deliver_text/2` and `deliver/2` feed synthetic inbound messages
  through the real decode/classify pipeline, so your bot receives a true
  `%Amarula.Msg{}`. `send_media/5` is unsupported offline (needs a live socket).
- `Amarula.list_profiles/1` — list the profiles that have stored credentials in a
  given storage source (a `Conn`, a `Storage.Scope`, or a `{adapter, opts}` /
  bare-opts storage spec). Returns the names you'd pass as `:profile` to reconnect.
- `Amarula.list_profiles_with_metadata/1` — like `list_profiles/1`, but each entry
  carries the logged-in identity read from that profile's creds
  (`%{profile, jid, lid, name}`), for building account pickers.
- `Amarula.Storage` gains an optional `list_profiles/1` behaviour callback,
  implemented by the `File` and `DETS` adapters. Adapters that don't implement it
  report `{:error, :not_supported}`.

### Changed

- **Teardown API reworked.** `wipe_credentials/1` is now the single destructive
  path: it unlinks the companion server-side (`remove-companion-device`, the phone
  drops the device), wipes **all** local storage for the profile, then disconnects.
  After it, the profile must be re-paired.

### Removed

- **`Amarula.logout/1` removed.** For a non-destructive teardown that keeps
  credentials, use `disconnect/1` (closes the websocket only) or `stop/1` (takes
  the supervision tree down and frees the profile slot). The server-side
  device-unlink now lives only in `wipe_credentials/1`.
